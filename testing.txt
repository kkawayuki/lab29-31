Going to conduct unit testing for various parts of the program:

Points of concern for the application
1. Correct reading in of data to respective lists
2. List correct association with stocks
3. Correct calculation of a volume trading estimate

Addressing points of concern:

1/2. Write a program to print out a stock's name followed by the price data corresponding to that stock
The function will work for each of 2 sectors, for each of 3 stocks. Because each stock posesses 30 days of 
data, the function will format/print 180 lines of data concisely into the terminal. 






3. For the volume trading estimate, it will operate based on the price of the stock. For example, a popular,
high-valued stock will have higher trading volume than that of a smaller company (reason for inclusion of CTLP)
using a function to output the estimates for trade comparing a huge company (ex: NVDA) to a smaller one should give
a vastly different estimate proportional to the price of that current day.
