Going to conduct unit testing for various parts of the program:

Points of concern for the application
1. Correct reading in of data to respective lists
2. List correct association with stocks
3. Correct calculation of a volume trading estimate

Addressing points of concern:

1/2. Write a program to print out a stock's name followed by the price data corresponding to that stock
The function will work for each of 2 sectors, for each of 3 stocks. Because each stock posesses 30 days of 
data, the function will format/print 180 lines of data concisely into the terminal. 


void testLists(map<string, array<list<int>, 3>> app)
{
    // for commserv sector
    cout << "TESTING COMMSERV SECTOR: \n";
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_STOCKS; i++)
    {
        cout << matchCompany("CommServ", i) << '\n'; // test the ability of matchCompany for the "Commserv" array

        auto &companyList = app["CommServ"][i]; // address
        int j = 0;
        for (int val : companyList)
        {
            cout << val << " ";
            if (j % 10 == 0 && j != 0)
                cout << '\n'; // formatting
            j++;
        }
        cout << '\n';
    }
    cout << "\n"; //format

    cout << "TESTING INFOTECH SECTOR: \n";
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_STOCKS; i++)
    {
        cout << matchCompany("InfoTech", i) << '\n'; // test the ability of matchCompany for the "Commserv" array

        auto &companyList = app["InfoTech"][i]; // address
        int j = 0;
        for (int val : companyList)
        {
            cout << val << " ";
            if (j % 10 == 0 && j != 0)
                cout << '\n'; // formatting
            j++;
        }
        cout << '\n';
    }
}


3. For the volume trading estimate, it will operate based on the price of the stock. For example, a popular,
high-valued stock will have higher trading volume than that of a smaller company (reason for inclusion of CTLP)
using a function to output the estimates for trade comparing a huge company (ex: NVDA) to a smaller one should give
a vastly different estimate proportional to the price of that current day.
