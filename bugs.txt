File To Describe Bugs I come across
"short descriptions of bugs you encountered while coding and testing, and how you corrected them"

1. Information printing not iterating correctly through lists
Implementation of .front() , .pop_front() algorithms to assist with access
(because random access is unusable in an std::list). 

2. Difficulty implementing print functionality:
Moved printing functionality into the calculating function 
of the program to reduce the amount of references needed to be
passed, function now calculates then prints relevant Information.


3. Output of function incorrectly staggered, not displaying random marketwide events: 
corrected formatting and updated parameter list to include the market climate through 
inclusion of an: int classification variable.


4. calcTradeVolume() function not accessing list elements correctly due to inability to random access: 
corrected syntax to abide by std::list conventions.  ADDMORE


5. Oversight of how trade volume might be calculated (very incorrect calculation)
Update logic to reflect various aspects of stock might react
- clarify that volume refers to the monetary value of stocks traded (volume neither positive/negative)
- reflects the general popularity of the stock, (has proportionality to pricing)
