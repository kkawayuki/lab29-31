File To Describe Bugs I come across
"short descriptions of bugs you encountered while coding and testing, and how you corrected them"

1. Information printing not iterating correctly through lists


2. Difficulty implementing print functionality:

Moved printing functionality into the calculating function 
of the program to reduce the amount of references needed to be
passed, function now calculates then prints relevant Information.


3. Output of function incorrectly staggered, not displaying random marketwide events

corrected formatting and updated parameter list to include the market climate through 
inclusion of an: int classification variable.


4. calcTradeVolume() function not accessing list elements correctly due to inability to random access

corrected syntax to abide by std::list conventions.  ADDMORE
