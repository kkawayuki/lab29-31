BUGS AND FIXES

1. Information printing not iterating correctly through lists
Implementation of .front() , .pop_front() algorithms to assist with access
(because random access is unusable in an std::list). 

2. Difficulty implementing print functionality:
Moved printing functionality into the calculating function 
of the program to reduce the amount of references needed to be
passed, function now calculates then prints relevant Information.


3. Output of function incorrectly staggered, not displaying random marketwide events: 
corrected formatting and updated parameter list to include the market climate through 
inclusion of an: int classification variable.


4. calcTradeVolume() function not accessing list elements correctly due to inability to random access: 
corrected syntax to abide by std::list conventions.  ADDMORE


5. Oversight of how trade volume might be calculated (very incorrect calculation)
Update logic to reflect various aspects of stock might react
- clarify that volume refers to the monetary value of stocks traded (volume neither positive/negative)
- reflects the general popularity of the stock, (has proportionality to pricing)

6. volume output too large to be represented by double (started printing in scientific notation)
Updated output logic to only print to 2nd decimal precision to standardize output

7. 


THINGS I COULD IMPROVE UPON

1. Program doesn't take into account market cap of stocks, only prices
causes over/underestimation of company popularity based on the current price of one share,
as companies that split shares are underrepresented in their trade volume as a result

2. In real life, events such as Rallies/Issues in the market are rarely market or even sector-wide,
often pertaining to specific companies only. This simulation does not account for that level
of precision, instead abstracting to a market-wide level for simplicity of calculation

3. Expandability of program is quesitonable due to the number of manual loop setups for things like
calculation and output, to add another sector and corresponding companies for example, there'd be a
lot of work with adding another text file for prices, loops, and relating integers to companies.
